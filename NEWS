Version 1.5 (27 March 2015):
============================

Several functions added (together with their documentation) to accommodate a break in dependency on the gets-package

Version 1.4 (22 October 2014):
==============================

Stylistic changes to manuals (required by CRAN)

Version 1.3 (22 October 2014):
==============================

The changes in this version is mainly to accommodate the creation of the successor of AutoSEARCH: gets (also available on the CRAN). The gets package is based on code from AutoSEARCH, but is more user-friendly, faster and easier to extend. AutoSEARCH will continue to be maintained, but the development focus will switch to gets.

The main changes to AutoSEARCH are:

- dependency on the gets and lgarch packages (in addition to zoo); the former because several of the auxiliary functions (see next point) have been moved to the gets package, and the latter because the gLag function has been modified to become a call to the glag function in lgarch

- functions eqwma, info.criterion, jb.test, leqwma and skewness.test have been deleted from the AutoSEARCH package, since they are now contained in the gets package

- many stylistic changes to the help-files
